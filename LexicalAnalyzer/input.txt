// Welcome to the expression playground!
// Let's mix some arithmetic with a touch of magic.

// Perform basic arithmetic operations and show the results.
// Note: Expressions are evaluated from left to right.

// Add some numbers and divide the result by 2
10 + (128 div 4);  // This is a note

// Calculate the remainder of 5 divided by 2 and multiply by the magical world
5 mod 2 * world

// Let's spice it up with more expressions!
// Feel free to experiment and discover the wonders of programming.

// Subtract 7 from 20 and add 3 to the result
20 - 7 + 3;

// Divide 100 by 10 and then multiply the result by 5
(100 div 10) * 5;

// Perform a complex operation: divide 1000 by 25, add 30, and then subtract 10
(1000 div 25) + 30 - 10;

// Multiply 4 by 3 and then add 7
4 * 3 + 7;

// Calculate the remainder of 16 divided by 3, and then divide the result by 2
16 mod 3 div 2;

// End of expressions
